## Translating

Traq ships with an english language file as default. Alternative languages can be found in the official forum (http://forum.traq.io/forumdisplay.php?fid=35).

The files linked there need to be downloaded and added to the vendor/traq/locale/directory

### Own translations

To create your own translation just copy the english language file (enus.php) and modify its content to your needs.

### Activating the newly added language file

To activate the language you just added there are 2 possibilities:

- Choose that language in AdminCP as default for every user
- Choose that language in UserCP only for your user
