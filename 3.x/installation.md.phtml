[This](https://www.rosehosting.com/blog/how-to-install-traq-on-an-ubuntu-16-04-vps/) tutorial guides you through step-by-step on how to install Traq on Ubuntu 16.04

#### Installing from repository

Clone the [Traq](https://traq.io) repository then checkout the latest version.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/nirix/traq
    git checkout v3.6.0

Then follow the last two steps above.

### Upgrading

Upgrading is very similar to the installation, download the latest version of
[Traq](https://traq.io) and unzip the archive, then upload the contents of the
`upload` directory.

Then simply open the web address of your installation and head to `/install/upgrade.php`.
